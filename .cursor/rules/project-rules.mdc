# Project Overview

This is a Laravel e-commerce application built with the Laravel Starter Kit for React. The project uses Inertia.js to connect the Laravel backend with React frontend components.

## Core Features

### User Management & Authentication
- User authentication system (clients can log in to their accounts)
- Guest checkout functionality (users can make purchases without creating an account)
- Admin dashboard for managing the platform

### E-Commerce Functionality
- **Product Catalog**: Users can browse and view products
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to a shopping cart
- **Order Management**: Users can place orders (both authenticated users and guests)
- **Inventory Management**: Admin can manage product inventory

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend**: React with Inertia.js
- **Authentication**: Laravel Fortify (based on the project structure)
- **Database**: SQLite (development) with migrations for production flexibility

## Development Guidelines
- Follow Laravel best practices and conventions
- Use React components for frontend UI
- Maintain separation between admin and client-facing features
- Ensure guest checkout flow is seamless and secure
